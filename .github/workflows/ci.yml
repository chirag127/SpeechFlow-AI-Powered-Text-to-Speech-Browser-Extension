    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [20.x] # Using Node.js 20.x for compatibility with Vite and browser extension development

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci # Use npm ci for cleaner installs in CI environments

    - name: Lint code with Ruff (via Biome integration if applicable) and TypeScript
      run: npm run lint # Assuming a lint script exists in package.json for unified linting

    - name: Run Unit Tests with Vitest
      run: npm test # Assuming npm test runs Vitest

    # If E2E tests are part of the matrix, add them here.
    # Example for Playwright E2E tests:
    # - name: Install Playwright Browsers
    #   run: npx playwright install --with-deps
    # - name: Run End-to-End Tests with Playwright
    #   run: npm run e2e # Assuming npm run e2e executes Playwright tests

    - name: Build browser extensions (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
      run: |
        npm run build:chrome
        npm run build:firefox
        npm run build:edge
      env:
        NODE_ENV: production # Ensure production build optimizations

    - name: Upload build artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: speechflow-extension-builds
        path: |
          dist/chrome
          dist/firefox
          dist/edge
        retention-days: 7 # Keep artifacts for 7 days

    # Optional: Deploy to specific stores (e.g., Chrome Web Store, AMO) would require separate jobs and secrets management.
    # This CI focuses on building and basic testing.
